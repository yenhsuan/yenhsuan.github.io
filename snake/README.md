# Project: Snake

The project "Snake" is a classic arcade game in which a player controls a snake, guiding it towards
food and away from walls or itself.

This project was implemented using JavaScript ES6, and based on HTML5 Canvas to render the game.

## Instruction

1. Open Snake.html using a modem browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari..) supporting HTML5 Canvas.
2. Use `space` or NEW GAME button to start a game.
3. Move the snake by `arrow keys`, and pause/resume the game using `space` key.

## Feature Work

1. UI
In this project, I focused on the game strategy part so that I didn't use too much time on designing the UI. The snake was built by couple of rectangles, and the food was merely a colored square.

2. Player name/ Highest score/ Leaderboard
I can use localstorage to keep track of every player's scores, and display a leaderboard on the screen.
